# PitchAllocation
Exploring the world of AWS with a Pitch Allocation system for my grassroots team

Step 1:
Build a Python application that takes a list of pitches and teams and tries to allocate the teams across the pitches 

Step 2:
Allow the user to specify more details about the allocation process (which teams, which pitches) 

Step 3:
Create a UI for the project in Python

Step 4:
Change it into a website that can be used by members of the grassroots team from their mobile







_Note: This read.me and project are being created after a fair amount of work has been already been completed. I will attempt to upload the code to the repository in stages (when I made significant improvements). Going forwards I will attempt to use Github for all features and stop saving lots of copies of the same work to my computer :D_
